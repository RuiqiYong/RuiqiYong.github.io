I am delighted to share that I participated in the IEEE EMBC 2024 in Orlando and presented posters for three works. My dear partner Hang Yuan and I attended together.

These works were completed under the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Pengfei Song. They are as follows:
1. [Automated Offline Smartphone-Assisted Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Device for Biomarker Detection of Alzheimer's Disease](https://ruiqiyong.github.io/publication/202404301), 16th July
2. [An Automated Paper-Based Analytical Device for Chemiluminescence Immunoassay](https://ruiqiyong.github.io/publication/202404302), 17th July
3. [Nanocellulose-Paper-Based Analytical Devices with MOFs/Heterojunction Structures for Multiplex SERS Detection](https://ruiqiyong.github.io/publication/20240506), 18th July

Thanks to the IEEE EMBS organization, and to Professors [Ranu Jung](https://bme.fiu.edu/people/faculty-instructors/ranu-jung/), [Metin Akay](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276994000), and [Paul Sajda](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37276046800) for their efforts. Their encouragement at the Sydney EMBC 2023 a year ago became my motivation to move forward.
Thank you very much to Prof. Metin for sharing our work on LinkedIn.
