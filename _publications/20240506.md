#excerpt: 'Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates exhibit selectivity towards analytes with different energy levels. However, due to the energy level mismatch, the multiplex SERS detection on the same substrate has not been developed yet. In this study, we demonstrated nanocellulose-paper-based analytical devices (NanoPADs) with both in-situ ZIF-8/Zn(OH)2and ZIF-67/Co(OH)2 structures. As a proof-of-concept, we independently detected two common environmental pollutants, methyl orange and Rhodamine 6G, on NanoPADs under different incident light wavelengths, achieving limits of detection as 10-7 M, respectively. Our work potentially advances high-sensitive and multiplex SERS-based device development.'
