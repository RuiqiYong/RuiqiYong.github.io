#excerpt: 'Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, results in severe cognitive decline and irreversible memory loss. Early detection of AD is significant to patients for personalized intervention since effective cure and treatment methods for AD are still lacking. Despite the severity of the disease, existing highly sensitive AD detection methods, including neuroimaging and brain deposit-positive lesion tests, are not suitable for screening purposes due to their high cost and complicated operation. Therefore, these methods are unsuitable for early detection, especially in low-resource settings. Although regular paper-based microfluidics are cost-efficient for AD detection, they are restricted by a poor limit of detection (LOD). Results: To address the above limitations, we report the ultrasensitive and low-cost nanocellulose paper (nanopaper)-based analytical microfluidic devices (NanoPADs) for detecting one of the promising AD blood biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) using Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) immunoassay. Nanopaper offers advantages as a SERS substrate, such as an ultrasmooth surface, high optical transparency, and tunable chemical properties. We detected the target GFAP in artificial serum, achieving a LOD of 150 fg mL-1. Significance: The developed NanoPADs are distinguished by their cost-efficiency and ease of implementation, presenting a promising avenue for effective early detection of AD's GFAP biomarker with ultrahigh sensitivity. More importantly, our work provides the experimental routes for SERS-based immunoassay of biomarkers on NanoPADs for various diseases in the future.'
