#excerpt: 'Nanocomposite represents the backbone of many industrial fabrication applications and exerts a substantial social impact. Among these composites, metal nanostructures are often employed as the active constituents, thanks to their various chemical and physical properties, which offer the ability to tune the application scenarios in thermal management, energy storage, and biostable materials, respectively. Nanocellulose, as an emerging polymer substrate, possesses unique properties of abundance, mechanical flexibility, environmental friendliness, and biocompatibility. Based on the combination of flexible nanocellulose with specific metal fillers, the essential parameters involving mechanical strength, flexibility, anisotropic thermal resistance, and conductivity can be enhanced. Nowadays, the approach has found extensive applications in thermal management, energy storage, biostable electronic materials, and piezoelectric devices. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly correlate cellulose nanocomposites’ properties with different metallic fillers. This review summarizes the extraction of nanocellulose and preparation of metal modified cellulose nanocomposites, including their wide and particular applications in modern advanced devices. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges in the synthesis, the emerging designs, and unique structures, promising directions for future research. We wish this review can give a valuable overview of the unique combination and inspire the research directions of the multifunctional nanocomposites using proper cellulose and metallic fillers.'
