#excerpt: 'Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of crystalline microporous materials with metal ions, have gained considerable interest as promising substrate materials for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection via charge transfer. Research on MOF-based SERS substrates has advanced rapidly because of the MOFs’ excellent structural tunability, functionalizable pore interiors, and ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratios. Compared with traditional noble metal SERS plasmons, MOFs exhibit better biocompatibility, ease of operation, and tailorability. However, MOFs cannot produce a sufficient limit of detection (LOD) for ultrasensitive detection, and therefore, developing an ultrasensitive MOF-based SERS substrate is imperative. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop an MOFs/heterojunction structure as an SERS enhancing material. We report an in situ ZIF-67/Co(OH)2 heterojunction-based nanocellulose paper (nanopaper) plate (in situ ZIF-67 nanoplate) as a device with an LOD of 0.98 nmol/L for Rhodamine 6G and a Raman enhancement of 1.43 × 107, which is 100 times better than that of the pure ZIF-67-based SERS substrate. Further, we extend this structure to other types of MOFs and develop an in situ HKUST-1 nanoplate (with HKUST-1/Cu(OH)2). In addition, we demonstrate that the formation of heterojunctions facilitates efficient photoinduced charge transfer for SERS detection by applying the Mx(OH)y-assisted (where M = Co, Cu, or other metals) MOFs/heterojunction structure. Finally, we successfully demonstrate the application of medicine screening on our nanoplates, specifically for omeprazole. The nanoplates we developed still maintain the tailorability of MOFs and perform high anti-interference ability. Our approach provides customizing options for MOF-based SERS detection, catering to diverse possibilities in future research and applications.'
