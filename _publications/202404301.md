#excerpt: 'This paper presents a smartphone-assisted microfluidic paper-based analytical device (μPAD), which was applied to detect Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, especially in resource-limited regions. This device implements deep learning (DL)-assisted offline smartphone detection, eliminating the requirement for large computing devices and cloud computing power. In addition, a smartphone-controlled rotary valve enables a fully automated colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) on μPADs. It reduces detection errors caused by human operation and further increases the accuracy of μPAD c-ELISA. We realized a sandwich c-ELISA targeting β-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Aβ 1-42) in artificial plasma, and our device provided a detection limit of 15.07 pg/mL. We collected 750 images for the training of the DL YOLOv5 model. The training accuracy is 88.5%, which is 11.83% higher than the traditional curve-fitting result analysis method. Utilizing the YOLOv5 model with the NCNN framework facilitated offline detection directly on the smartphone. Furthermore, we developed a smartphone application to operate the experimental process, realizing user-friendly rapid sample detection.'
