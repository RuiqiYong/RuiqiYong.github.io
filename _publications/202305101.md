title: "A Centrifugation-Assisted Lateral Flow Assay Platform for Bioassay Sensitivity and Visualization Enhancement"
collection: Publications
permalink: /publication/202305101
#excerpt: 'This study presents a centrifugation-assisted lateral flow assay (CLFA) platform that addresses the limited sensitivity and uncontrollable incubation time of traditional lateral flow assays (LFA). The CLFA platform generates a centrifugal force by controlling the motor to improve the flow rate controllability and optimize incubation time at the test line (T line). As a proof-of-concept, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was chosen for quantification to validate the sensitivity and visualization enhancements. The centrifuged experiment group exhibits better linearity (R2=0.9795) with the logarithm of the concentration (0-2000 mIU/mL) than the uncentrifuged control group. And the T line intensity enhances by an average of 8.23%. Our CLFA platform potentially improves early screening and advances point-of-care testing development.'
