#excerpt: 'Nanopaper, derived from nanofibrillated cellulose, has generated considerable interest as a promising material for microfluidic applications. Its appeal lies in a range of excellent qualities, including an exceptionally smooth surface, outstanding optical transparency, a uniform nanofiber matrix with nanoscale porosity, and customizable chemical properties. Despite the rapid growth of nanopaper-based microfluidics, the current techniques used to create microchannels on nanopaper, such as 3D printing, spray coating, or manual cutting and assembly, which are crucial for practical applications, still possess certain limitations, notably susceptibility to contamination. Furthermore, these methods are restricted to the production of millimeter-sized channels. This study introduces a straightforward process that utilizes convenient plastic micro-molds for simple microembossing operations to fabricate microchannels on nanopaper, achieving a minimum width of 200 µm. The developed microchannel outperforms existing approaches, achieving a fourfold improvement, and can be fabricated within 45 min. Furthermore, fabrication parameters have been optimized, and a convenient quick-reference table is provided for application developers. The proof-of-concept for a laminar mixer, droplet generator, and functional nanopaper-based analytical devices (NanoPADs) designed for Rhodamine B sensing using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was demonstrated. Notably, the NanoPADs exhibited exceptional performance with improved limits of detection. These outstanding results can be attributed to the superior optical properties of nanopaper and the recently developed accurate microembossing method, enabling the integration and fine-tuning of the NanoPADs.'
